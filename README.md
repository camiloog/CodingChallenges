# Coding challenges

This is a list of coding challenges solved in C #. Each code challenge has its solution in a separate class and is verified in its test class. The challenges solved are listed below.

### Common Elements
Given two ascending sorted arrays A, B the solution should find the elements common in the two arrays and return an array of the common elements.
[Code](CodingChallenges/CommonElements.cs)

### Format Telephone
Given a string with a phone number including chars different from numbers, make a function to format the phone number so is expressed in groups of 3 numbers in the end they can be grouped in one or two groups of 2 numbers. 
[Code](CodingChallenges/FormatTelephone.cs)

### Is Array Rotation Of Array
Given the arrays of integers A and B define a function that returns true if B is a rotation of array A. Assume there are no duplicates ant they have the same length.
[Code](CodingChallenges/IsArrayRotationOfArray.cs)  

### Linked List On Array
Given a no empty array of items A implementing a linked list, write a function to return the number of nodes of the list if the firs item represents the first node, its value represent the index of the next node on the array and a value of -1 represent the last node of the list.
[Code](CodingChallenges/LinkedList.cs)

### Minimum Positive Integer Not Occurring
Given the array A find the minimum positive integer not occurring on the array.
[Code](CodingChallenges/MinPositiveIntegerNotOccurring.cs)

### Most Frequent
Given the unsorted array A of integers find the most frequent element on the array.
[Code](CodingChallenges/MostFrequent.cs)

### NonRepeatingCharacter
Given a string S find the first non repeating character found in the string.
[Code](CodingChallenges/NonRepeatingCharacter.cs)

### OneAwayStrings
Given two strings A and B return true if they are one operation away from each other. The allowed operations are: change a character, remove a character and add a character.
